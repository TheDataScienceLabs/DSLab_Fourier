    "In a previous lab, we learned about modulating signals and in later one, we learned how to capture and manipulate audio using python. That served as a good primer on how to manipulate audio in Python.  We now combine the ideas from the earlier laboratories to create a real-time voice changer. If the time taken for processing data is more than a few milliseconds, we will be forced to either skip sections of audio or have a substantial lag between input and output. In this lab, we will explore ways to minimize latency in producing the modulated output inorder to process the audio in realtime. But before that let us look into audio recordng and playback with Python.\n",
